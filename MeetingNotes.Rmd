## Monday, January 22

- discussed our goals and courses (topics, students, etc.)

- plan to create apps to address ML topics (bias-variance trade-off)

- activities on data ethics (to be discussed later)

- Abhishek wnated to know about learnR tutorials (to be thought of later)

- activities related to ChatGPT, etc. (to be thought of later), Eric referred to Vimal



## Monday, January 29

- created GitHub repo

- discuss basic version of a couple of apps

- HAVE TO FIX the scale on flexibility

- discuss more such apps to address the concept of variance using multiple training datasets (compare linear models with LASSO, splines, etc. using boxplot of parameter estimates, with multiple scatterplots?)



## Monday, February 12

- scale on flexibility FIXED (on `Flex.R`)

- created a new app demonstrating bias and variance (`Bias_Variance.R`)

- PLANS: demonstrate KNN and single Decision Trees, Eric mentioned adding histograms of residuals, and add LASSO and ridge boxplots of parameter estimates

- two students might be working with Abhishek on these apps during Spring term

- idea about developing lesson plans associated with the apps (discussed in THIRD FLC meeting, see Google Drive folder)

- plan to have the apps ready before next Winter term

- will meet next week



## Monday, February 19

- Abhishek did not have time to work on the apps

- Eric updated the bias-variance app with histograms (at a different branch)

- We discussed of possible variations - hollow histograms, density plots, etc. (TO DO)

- We talked about `Default` dataset from Intro to Stat Learning with R (James et al.) for first version of algorithmic bias study

- We talked about similar apps for Stat 2 level course developed by Keegan Kang (last FLC meeting)

- Found a similar app which can be used for reference (check assoicated article, and apps) [gursimar.github.io/d3-visualizations/bias-var/] 

- TO DO for Eric 

  - Put ML activities in GitHub folder and send to Abhishek 
  
  - Reach out to Colby at Wooster
  
  - Frame an idea of algorithmic bias
  
- TO DO for Abhishek

  - work on apps for KNN and trees 
  
  
  
  
## Monday, February 26

- Busy week/weekend for both of us, none of us could make any progress

- Will work on the TO DO lists from last meeting
