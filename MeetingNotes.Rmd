## Monday, January 22

- discussed our goals and courses (topics, students, etc.)

- plan to create apps to address ML topics (bias-variance trade-off)

- activities on data ethics (to be discussed later)

- Abhishek wnated to know about learnR tutorials (to be thought of later)

- activities related to ChatGPT, etc. (to be thought of later), Eric referred to Vimal



## Monday, January 29

- created GitHub repo

- discuss basic version of a couple of apps

- HAVE TO FIX the scale on flexibility

- discuss more such apps to address the concept of variance using multiple training datasets (compare linear models with LASSO, splines, etc. using boxplot of parameter estimates, with multiple scatterplots?)



## Monday, February 12

- scale on flexibility FIXED (on `Flex.R`)

- created a new app demonstrating bias and variance (`Bias_Variance.R`)

- PLANS: demonstrate KNN and single Decision Trees, Eric mentioned adding histograms of residuals, and add LASSO and ridge boxplots of parameter estimates

- two students might be working with Abhishek on these apps during Spring term

- idea about developing lesson plans associated with the apps

- plan to have the apps ready before next Winter term

- will meet next week
